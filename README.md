# Blocky Wad v5   
### Batch Test Gray
A very work in progress Blocky texture batch test.  
Features 3 colors: white, gray and black.  
No functional transparencies, expect some misalignments.
Not intended for proper maps, these textures will be reworked in future updates.

### Trenchbroom Texture Scaling
These textures are designed to be displayed at a higher texel density than normal.
The size of a single `1x1 Block` should be equal to `16x16 Quake Units`.
Within Trenchbroom, every brush should have it's `X Scale` and `Y Scale` set to `0.5`
